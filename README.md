# EWS Email Attachment Saver Generalized
This is a fork of [techspence's EWSEmailAttachmentSaver](https://github.com/techspence/EWSEmailAttachmentSaver). Main difference is that this script allows you to specify the name of the attachment you are looking for, and save to a folder location where the folder path of the attachment destination is based on when the email was received.
